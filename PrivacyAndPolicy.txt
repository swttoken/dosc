Further, we may collect some Personal Information from you when you communicate with us, including your contact information, such as your phone number, social media handle, or email address (depending on how you reach out).

This UDID will not be tied to users’ identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when users access our Services using multiple devices.

If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used SWT Wallet, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at support@swttoken.com
ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user.
Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including SWT Wallet, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals.
CHANGES AND UPDATES TO PRIVACY POLICY
We reserve the right to update and revise this privacy policy at any time. We occasionally review this Privacy Policy to make sure it complies with applicable laws and conforms to changes in our business. We may need to update this Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to do so at any time. If we do revise this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Effective Date” at the bottom of this page so that you can tell if it has changed since your last visit and will do our best to notify you. Please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of its terms. Any use of SWT Wallet after an amendment to our Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance to the revised or amended agreement.
